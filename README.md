🎨 Color Tones
A responsive color palette generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📍 Overview
This project allows users to generate a custom color palette by selecting a seed color and choosing a scheme mode. It was one of my first deeper experiences with APIs and handling asynchronous data.

🧠 What I Learned
I practiced using fetch() to retrieve and render API data based on user input. This project helped me understand the basics of how REST APIs work — such as how GET requests and URL parameters pass information. Most importantly, it gave me confidence working with external data sources and updating the DOM dynamically.

🚀 Challenges & Highlights
What I really enjoyed about this project — even though it was challenging — was creating a colorful default display (a sort of rainbow placeholder), so that:

Users wouldn’t be greeted by a blank page with just a heading and buttons

They could immediately get a sense of what would be generated
