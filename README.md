## 🎨 Color Tones

*A responsive color palette generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.*

### 📍 Overview

This project allows users to generate a custom color palette by selecting a seed color and choosing a scheme mode. It was one of my first deeper experiences with APIs and handling asynchronous data.

### 🔬 What I Learned

I practiced using `fetch()` to retrieve and render API data based on user input. This project helped me understand the basics of how REST APIs work — like how GET requests and URL parameters can pass information. Most importantly, it gave me confidence working with external data sources and updating the DOM dynamically.

### 🤔 What Was Fun + Challenging

What I really enjoyed about this project — although it proved to be challenging — was creating the rainbow-colored placeholder palette. It served two important purposes:
1. It avoided showing a blank page with just a heading and buttons.
2. It helped users immediately understand what kind of results would be generated.
